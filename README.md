# POS-Restaurant
This is my Software Engineering project.
In this project, our task is to design a POS (Point of Sales) restaurant system, we are taught about :
- Requirement elicitation
- Drawing UML diagram
- Design pattern
- Architecture design

To be more specific: 
- For task 1, I was participated in defining the stakeholders, funtional and non-functional elicitations, drawing use-case diagram. 
- For task 2, I 'm in charged of the class diagram, which I choose to design it after facade pattern, following my instructor's advice on how to increase cohension and reduce coupling.
- For task 3, I'm in charge of the architectural pattern part.
- Finally come the implementation part, which I'm reponsible for the front-end development.
